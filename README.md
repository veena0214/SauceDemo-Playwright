Framework is PlayWright ( Ref : https://playwright.dev/) (Other regression framework won’t be accepted)
Coding must be done in JS or TS - npx playwright test
Test data must be in CSV format (Data driven)
Use Cucumber based BDD framework

Once Coding completed code must be upload into github
One command like “npm test” or shellscript/bat must be written to run whole framework
For failure it must take screenshot
Code must run in headless mode
All information of the framework must be documented in “README.md” file
Running inside github action pipeline (Added Advantage)
